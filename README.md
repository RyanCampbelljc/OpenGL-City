This project is a 3D city simulation built using OpenGL, showcasing my ability to program graphics and render complex scenes. The city includes a variety of buildings, and roads, with attention to detail in texture mapping and lighting to create a realistic environment. Users can explore the city using an interactive camera, and experience real-time rendering of an urban landscape. This project highlights my skills in computer graphics and OpenGL programming, as well as my understanding of rendering pipelines
